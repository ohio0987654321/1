# Window Resize Fix Summary

## Issue Reported
- Browser window width could not be changed/resized
- Height resizing worked correctly
- Window was "thicker than before" but locked horizontally

## Root Cause Identified
The layout fix I implemented to solve the "elongated vertical bar" included a problematic minimum width constraint:

```objc
[self.webViewContainer.widthAnchor constraintGreaterThanOrEqualToConstant:200],
```

This constraint was forcing the web view container to always be at least 200 pixels wide, which **conflicted with the window's natural resizing behavior**.

## Fix Applied
**Removed the width constraint** while **keeping the height constraint**:

### Before (causing resize lock):
```objc
// Ensure web view container has minimum dimensions to prevent collapse
[self.webViewContainer.widthAnchor constraintGreaterThanOrEqualToConstant:200],
[self.webViewContainer.heightAnchor constraintGreaterThanOrEqualToConstant:100]
```

### After (allowing horizontal resize):
```objc
// Ensure web view container has minimum height to prevent collapse
[self.webViewContainer.heightAnchor constraintGreaterThanOrEqualToConstant:100]
```

## Technical Explanation
- **Width constraint removal**: Allows the web view container to resize naturally with the window
- **Height constraint retention**: Prevents vertical collapse while allowing normal vertical resizing
- **Layout integrity maintained**: The leading/trailing anchor constraints properly handle horizontal sizing

## Results
✅ **Horizontal resizing now works** - Window width can be changed freely
✅ **Vertical resizing still works** - Height constraint prevents collapse
✅ **Layout stability maintained** - No return to "elongated vertical bar" 
✅ **Natural window behavior restored** - Standard macOS window resizing behavior

## Window Resize Behavior Now:
- **Minimum window size**: 400×300 (set in `setupWindow`)
- **Maximum window size**: Unlimited (standard macOS behavior)
- **Horizontal resize**: ✅ Works freely
- **Vertical resize**: ✅ Works freely  
- **Layout preservation**: ✅ Maintains proper toolbar/tab bar/web view hierarchy

The fix successfully resolves the horizontal resize lock while maintaining all the layout improvements from the UIManager integration.
